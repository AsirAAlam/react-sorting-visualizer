# React Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## TO-DO

- Bug fixes:
  - Don't allow sort when sort is already running (only one instance of sort should run at most).
  - Hovering and then unhovering over a highlighted (white, black, etc.) tile during sorting removes highlight

- Add sorting speed selector
- Add more algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- For Length input:
  - Add up/down arrows
  - Don't allow NaN
- Cap length at n = 100
- Split input array into n textboxes instead of one comma separated.
  - Make it an array representation with 0-based index labeling
  - Scroll bar

  - Make textboxes, buttons, etc. look nicer
